This logger has been used and modified by copying from
one project to another for a long while...  So...
I suppose it's time to make it a project of it's own
that can be more easily tracked and included in projects
properly.

It's nothing special.  It's just a fairly minimalistic
logging architecture that aspired to be able to log things
to various different places one day.
